Locate the downloaded JAR file on your computer.

1. Copy the JAR file to the `C:/~Path-to-directory~/Internet-Download-Manager/lib` folder.

2. In your Java project, open the build configuration file (e.g., build.gradle or pom.xml) or the IDE's project settings.

3. Add the JAR file as a dependency in the build configuration or project settings. The exact steps may vary depending on the build tool or IDE you are using.

3. Save the changes to the build configuration or project settings.

4. Build or compile your Java project to ensure that the external library is properly included.
